[MacOS] Added support for older versions of MacOS.
## 20200914
Relink to fix problem with the licensing routines.
## 20200905

## 20200502
Relink the mswin64 binary to make the fix of 209200414 take full effect.
## 20200414
Relink to fix a rarely seen bug in the interface library. When the bug bit, an error message of the form "Unexpected opno 179 in eval2_ASL()" appeared.
## 20191219
Relink to fix a rarely seen bug in the interface library. When the bug bit, an error message of the form "Error: Knitro-AMPL failed to add quadratic constraint structure." appeared.
## 20191204
Update to KNITRO 12.1.0. New keywords findiff_relstepsize, infeastol_iters, pre_improvecoefficients, pre_redundancylevel, presolveop_tighten.
## 20190908
Relink to ignore any LOGWAIT keywords in the ampl.lic or ampl.netlic file.
## 20190711
Update 64-bit Linux binary so lpsolver=xpress will work with Xpress 8.6.
## 20190605, 20190606
Update to KNITRO 12.0.0, which has some improvements for mixed-integer programming.
## 20190315
Fix bugs that occasionally affected sparsity computations and that affected "objrep" when several objectives can be adjusted.
## 20181221
Relink to fix a bug with piecewise-linear terms when "option pl_linearize 0;" is specified in AMPL.
## 20190207
Update to KNITRO 11.1.2, which has some bug fixes and (on average) performance improvements. New keywords "bar_maxcorrectors", "cpuplatform", "findiff_terminate", "mip_cutfactor", "strat_warm_start". Withdrawn keyword "act_lpsolver" (instead use "lpsolver").
## 20181221
Relink to fix possible trouble with complicated uses of more than one imported function.
## 20181210
Relink to fix possible trouble with "and" and "or" expressions in 64-bit binaries.
## 20181120
Relink to ignore HEARTBEAT lines in the ampl.lic file.
## 20180925
Recreate the MacOSX64 bundle so libomp.dylib is a file rather than a MacOSX symbolic link to libomp5.dylib. This only matters to MacOSX systems that do not have libomp5.dylib in one of the usual places.
## 20180816
Relink to fix possible trouble with identifying quadratic objectives and constraints on large problems.
## 20180619
Update to KNITRO 11.0.1 to fix a bug seen in a problem with some integer variables and quadratic constraints.
## 20180609

## 20180525
Relink to compute tanh(x) and tanh'(x) for large |x| without complaint.
## 20180519
Relink to compute tanh(x) for large x without complaint.
## 20180515

## 20180402
Relink to fix a bug with nonlinear "if" expressions. Wrong gradients were possible.
## 20180314
Relink to fix a bug that gave error message "bad *o = ... in heswork".
## 20180302
Relink to fix error messages "Bad *o = 159 ..." or "... 127 ..." and to fix a bug (e.g., fault) with reading some large .nl files.

## 20170801
Relink to fix a bug, introduced 20170511, with derivatives of abs().

## 20170514
Fix a bug in the KNITRO driver that caused trouble on some problems.
## 20170511
Relink to fix a bug with defined variables shared by several constraints or objectives: under complicated conditions, it was possible for derivative evaluation errors to be ignored.
## 20161208
Update to Knitro 10.2.0, which has some bug fixes and performance improvements (64-bit Linux and MacOSX, 32- and 64-bit MS Windows only).
## 20160908
Update to Knitro 10.1.2, which has some bug fixes.
## 20160831
Relink to fix a bug in computing Hessians or Hessian-vector products when the same variable appears alone as the "then" or "else" part of two or more if-then-else expressions.
## 20160608
Update to Knitro 10.1.0, which has some bug fixes. Also fixed: a bug with expressions of the form expr^num (with num a numeric constant) in "group partially-separable" contexts.
## 20160329
Obscure bug fix: relink to fix a differentiation bug with the mod function.
## 20160111
Update to Knitro 10.0.1, which has some bug fixes.
## 20151211
Fix knitro.mswin*.zip bundles: knitro.mswin*.20151210.zip mistakenly contained outdated knitro.exe files.
## 20151210
Enable demo licenses.
## 20151208
Linux library search rules adjusted for consistency with other solvers; this should be invisible to most users.
## 20151031
Update to Knitro 10.0. Changed keyword: lpsolver --> act_lpsolver. New keywords: act_qpalg, bar_watchdog, derivcheck_terminate, fstopval, ftol, ftol_iters, maxfevals. See the "knitro -=" output for details.
## 20150814
MacOSX binary relinked to catch errors not reported via errno in evaluating some math functions.
## 20150630
Fix some possible trouble with a single-use license.
## 20150602
Relink to fix a bug that could afflict imported functions.
## 20150529
Relink Linux binaries to look initially in the current directory for system libraries.
## 20150424
Fix a rarely seen licensing glitch.
## 20150226
Fix a glitch that could give rise to an error message such as "can't evaluate exp(718.754)".
## 20150203
Fix a glitch with par_numthreads > 1 that caused some threads to see permuted Jacobian values and perform poorly.
## 20150126
Relink Linux binaries to not require GLIBC 2.14.
## 20150122
Relink to avoid trouble from miscomputed function values under unlikely conditions.
## 20150114
Relink so par_numthreads=n with n > 1 works as intended. (Version 20150112 was an initial attempt at this that could fault.)
## 20141210
Update to KNITRO 9.1, which has a new SQP algorithm and changes to some keywords; invoke "knitro -=" for a summary of the keywords.
## 20141124
Relink for better handling of imported functions that report an inability compute derivatives.
## 20141102
Relink to catch errors reported by imported functions.
## 20141013
Relink macosx binary so licenses can consider both hostname and local hostname.
## 20141004
Relink to fix a rarely seen bug in computing derivatives (incorrectly "fixed" in 20140929).
## 20140918
Relink MacOSX binary so it will look in the directory containing the knitro binary (as well as in the standard places) for libiomp5.dylib. This library (libiomp5.dylib, a support library for OpenMP) could well be used by other programs (if installed on the current system), in which case the best place for it is probably /usr/local/lib. The updated knitro binary, like the previous one, will also look in /usr/local/lib for libiomp5.dylib.
## 20140409
Relink 64-bit Linux binary to remove a dependency on GLIBC_2.14. "knitro -v" shows "driver(20140407), ASL(20140313)".
## 20140306
Update to KNITRO 9.0.1, which has some bug fixes.
## 20140305
Relink to fix a possible fault on problems where "objrep" matters. The 32-bit Linux and Solaris-Intel binaries remain at KNITRO 8.1.1.
## 20131219
Update to KNITRO 9.0.0. New keywords bar_relaxcons, linsolver_ooc, lsnumthreads (synonym par_lsnumthreads), optionsfile, tuner, tuner_maxtime_cpu, tuner_maxtime_real, tuner_optionsfile, tuner_outsub, tuner_terminate. More values (2 and 3, rather than just 0 and 1) for "feasible". New suffixes cfeastol, relaxbnd, xfeastol. See the updated documentation.
## 20131023
Ignore case in MAC addresses during license checks (an issue rarely seen). When ending execution under a floating license, try to read a reply from the license manager to circumvent bug sometimes seen in MS Windows.
## 20131018
Relink to extend library renaming: if an imported-function library name has "_32" or "_64" before the final "." and fails to load (perhaps after changing "32" to "64" or vice versa, as appropriate), try omitting the "_32" or "_64".
## 20131011
When more than one objective is present, if objno is not specified in $knitro_options, behave like other solvers by assuming objno=1, rather than giving exit code 1.
## 20130823
Fix possible litch (error message "bad e->a = ...") with Hessian computations when if-then-else, min(...), and max(...) are involved. Fix bug with "objno=..." when there are multiple objectives (possible wrong weight in Lagrangian Hessian).
## 20130606
Relink to fix a fault that was sometimes possible with objrep=2 or objrep=3.
## 20130525
Adjust driver to accept problems with nodes and arcs.
## 20130419
Fix a rarely seen bug (possible fault) with defined variables.
## 20130320
Relink MS Windows versions to make automatic starting of ampl_lic work better on some versions of MS Windows (not XP). It is still recommended not to rely on automatically starting ampl_lic.
## 20130308
Relink MacOSX version to remove dependency on /usr/local/lib/libgomp1.dylib .
## 20130130
Relink 64-bit Linux version to avoid the need for GLIBC_2.14.
## 20121220
Update to KNITRO 8.1 (currently 8.1.1).
## 20120813
Relink 64-bit Linux version to avoid the need for GLIBC_2.14.
## 20120624
Relink to fix a bug with complementarity problems having integer variables. (KNITRO still does not handle such problems well.) Again add vcomp100.dll to the mswin64 bundle; it was mistakenly left out of recent versions of this bundle.
## 20120620
Relink to give a sparser Hessian in some cases of division by a constant.
## 20120608
Fix a glitch that prevented a .sol file from being written when hessopt=n appears in $knitro_options with n = 2, 3, 4, or 6. (These settings are probably seldom if ever desirable.)
## 20120320
Adjust license-check in Linux versions for use with FreeBSD.
## 20120120
Relink to handle library names with '.' in a directory name but not in the basename (i.e., the name of the imported-function library).
## 20120117
Relink to simplify using a 64-bit knitro with a 32-bit AMPL or vice versa when imported functions are involved (loaded from a *.dll file). For a 64-bit knitro, if the library name involves '.' and the final '.' is preceded by "_32", change the "32" to "64". Otherwise, if the library fails to load and there is a '.' in the name, insert "_64" before the final '.'. (For 32-bit solvers, the rules are similar, with the roles of "32" and "64" reversed.)
## 20120115
Adding Microsoft's "redistributable" vcomp100.dll to the mswin64 bundle for KNITRO. It (vcomp100.dll) is only licensed for use with knitro.exe and other programs compiled by Microsoft's Visual Studio 10. If knitro.exe runs on your system without adding vcomp100.dll from the knitro.mswin64.*.zip bundle, then your system must already have a copy of vcomp100.dll in $Path, in which case you do not need a second copy.
## 20111229
Relink for use with single-user licenses.
## 20111206
Update to KNITRO 8.0. There is no 32-bit MacOSX version; use the 64-bit version instead. (You can use a 32-bit AMPL with a 64-bit solver, and vice versa.) The MKL blas are now built into the knitro binaries.
## 20111107
Permit use of single-user licenses.
## 20111018
Relink to fix possible trouble with some complementarity problems.
## 20111005
Fix a possible fault in some cases when objrep > 0.
## 20111003
When processing ampl.lic, ignore new keywords for ampl.netlic.
## 20110915
Adding MKL blas libraries to mswin32 and mswin64 bundles.
## 20110822
New keyword available in $knitro_options: objrep controls whether a linear objective involving a single variable that appears linearly in exactly one constraint is replaced by the body of the constraint. Invoke "knitro -=" for details.
Complementarity problems are now handled in full generality.
A rarely-seen fault (a bug in the solver-interface library) is now fixed.
## 20110527
Relink to permit a quoted "hostname" for MGR_IP in the ampl.lic file for a floating license.
## 20110426
Tweak license checker to correct a rare problem on MS Windows systems.
## 20110117
Mention "knitro" in the "No license for this machine" message.
## 20101013
Update to KNITRO 7.0.
